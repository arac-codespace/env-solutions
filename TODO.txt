Add featured boolean.  In react, check for boolean and filter results accordingly. -- Done

Some considerations... If I want a featured filter, I'd have to make a query for featured projects. 

The problem is that to populate the other filters, I'd need to make another query.

Furthermore, how do I go about managing the featured boolean? I can just add the field and 
make it default to false.  Then I can manually set the projects I want to feature through admin...

In the API, sort results by date or name... -- Done by created_at

In projects component, increase the img size of one of the projects if number of projects is odd... ~optional~

In projects component, limit number of projects that can be displayed at once. -- Done
